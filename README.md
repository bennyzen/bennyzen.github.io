This boilerplate comes with some opinionated builtin features:

- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) as bundler with HMR
- [GSAP](https://greensock.com/gsap/) as animation library
- [OrbitControls](https://threejs.org/docs/#examples/en/controls/OrbitControls) for camera panning
- [lil-gui](https://lil-gui.georgealways.com/) as interactive debug panel
- [stats.js](https://github.com/mrdoob/stats.js/) to measure performance

Use this repo as a template or starting point for other repos or quick experiments using ThreeJS.

Do `npm i` and `npm run dev` to start using it.
